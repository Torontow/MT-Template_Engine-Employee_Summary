## Description 

Good day! When you create a team for a project, you would like to have a summary of team members in a file you can use to easily reference names, roles, contact information, and depending on their role, other pertinent information. Using Inquirer.js, this project allows a user to answer some questions about their team members and outputs a nice organized set of cards with all the employee information.

## Installation

Users will download the code from the github accout reference below. Note that Node.js, Inquirer.js, and Jest are required. Run npm install first to install dependencies, then run node app.js to begin.

## Usage

When you hit enter after typing "node app.js", you will be asked to choose the role of the employee you would like to add. Then, depending on the role you choose, you will be asked to answer a series of questions requiring input. The questions vary slightly from role to role. For example, a manager will require an office number, but an intern will require a school. Once the questions are answered, you'll be asked if you'd like to add another. You may add as many as you wish. Once finished, you will select "no" when prompted in order to generate a new file called team.html which you will find in the output directory. It will be formatted so that each employee will appear in a card in the file with clickable email addresses and GitHub accounts, if applicable.
